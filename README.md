# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Overview
This project implements a Rubik's Cube solver using various algorithms, including:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
- Iterative Deepening A* Search (IDA*)
- Corner Pattern Database for optimized solving

It provides different representations of a Rubik's Cube:
1. 3D Array
2. 1D Array
3. Bitboard

The main program demonstrates testing, shuffling, and solving the cube using these algorithms.

## Features
- **Cube Representations**: Support for multiple representations of a Rubik's Cube, enabling diverse implementation and testing.
- **Solvers**: Various solvers are implemented to demonstrate different approaches to solving the cube.
- **Pattern Databases**: Uses a corner pattern database for faster solving with IDA*.
- **Shuffling**: Randomly shuffle the cube with a given number of moves.
