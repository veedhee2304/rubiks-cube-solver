# rubiks-cube-solver
 The Rubik's Cube Solver is a C++ project with multiple cube representations (3D array, 1D array, bitboard) and solvers like DFS, BFS, IDDFS, and IDA*. It features random shuffling and heuristic optimization using a corner pattern database, offering a robust framework for solving and studying Rubik's Cube algorithms and complexities.
